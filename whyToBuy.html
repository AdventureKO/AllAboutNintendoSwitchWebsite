			<h2>Nintendo Switch Versus Competitors</h2>
			<p>Nintendo is one of the three main console creating companies currently, the other two being Sony and Microsoft. Each of these have their own current console and variations on the market right now, Nintendo having the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite, Sony having the Playstation 5 Digital Edition and Playstation 5 Physical Edition, and Microsoft having the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Here are the reasons why you should buy a Nintendo Switch over its competitors.</p>

			<h3>First Party Exclusive Games</h3>
			<p>The Nintendo Switch stands out from its competitors software wise due to its exclusive high-quality first party games that are made in house by Nintendo itself. The most recognizable faces in gaming history, such as Mario, Link, Kirby and Pikachu, all have best selling games on the Nintendo Switch that cannot be found in the Xbox or Playstation game libraries.</p>

			<h3>More Diverse And Abundant Games</h3>
			<p>Currently, the latest productions from Sony and Microsoft, the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, are relatively new consoles. The Nintendo Switch, on the other hand, is going strong while approaching its fifth year. Indie developers have had more time to publish more games on the Switch, leading to a more vast game selection on the Nintendo eShop compared to the sequels of the same games found on Xbox or Playstation. Most games are also very family-friendly, making it a great system for kids and parents to play together.</p>

			<h3>On The Go Gaming</h3>
			<p>The biggest feature that helps the Switch stand out in comparison to the Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 is its two in one hybrid functionality that lets it serve as a dedicated home console and an on the go system. Many busy gamers or the casual audience may not have the time to sit in front of the TV and play games for dedicated playing sessions, but prefer to resume a game whenever they have a few minutes to play. Mobile Gaming is becoming more popular as people spend more and more time with their phones, and the Nintendo Switch provides home console quality games with the convienience of a phone.</p>

			<h3>Lower Price</h3>
			<p>Despite not having as great graphics (1080p rather than 4K) or processing power as the Xbox Series X or Playstation 5, the Nintendo Switch makes up for that by being much cheaper and more accessible for the market demand. The Nintendo Switch costs $300 while the Lite costs only $200. The Playstation 5 Physical Edition is $500 but the Digital Edition is $400. The Xbox Series X is also $500 and the Series S costs $300. The Nintendo Switch is also cheaper in online costs, costing only $20 a year to play online for all compatible games while Playstation Plus and Xbox Live cost $60 a year. Furthermore, controllers for local multiplayer are overall cheaper for Nintendo Switch as it comes with two Joy-cons off the bat (two people can play together) and two more can be bought for $80. A Pro Controller costs $70 but it features a more conventional controller layout similar to the Playstation Dual-Sense, which costs $70 for one controller and Xbox Wireless Controllers cost $60.</p>
